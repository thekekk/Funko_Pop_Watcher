Description
----------

This is a script to scrape funko pop websites to check for item availability. It sends notification via the app "Telegram". **NOTE: will only work on fixes as I have time. This is just a small script to get a Pop I need.** 

Running the utility from command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

	.\Funko_Pop_Watcher\dist\pop_bot.exe
	
	or
	
	python pop_bot.py

 For this process you will need to install pyinstaller for python.
